The things required before you make a wall of faces
------

* Python
* PIL: Python Image Library
* Download some equal sized avatar files(from some microbloging service?) to the folder palette
* Find a template image which size should be around 100x100, name it to template.png

run
```
% cd facewall
% python makewall.py prepare  # collect color info from palette avatars
% python makewall.py template.png
```

You will see a file wall.jpg if there is no error. good luck!
